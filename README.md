## About The Project

The digital transformation is not only changing our everyday lives, it is also creating an ever-increasing shortage of skilled craftspeople. Our app is designed to bring people together who want to support each other privately. Also due to the current shortage of craftsmen in many regions, we see the need for such a platform on which clients can find craftsmen. However, the jobs can also be about moving, assembling furniture or other services of this kind. Current companies are more likely to arrange professional assistance. Our application thus not only counteracts the aforementioned shortage of skilled workers, but also promotes a culture of sustainability in the context of current issues such as climate change. Various items could be given a second chance through the growing and, above all, low-cost support and indirectly lead to a reduced use of resources in production.
